# Objective
Write a code of Conway's Game of Life as pastime using really basic Javascript, HTML and CSS concepts to make understandable even for beginners.<br>
Fully commented (really).

# Rules
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
3) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

# About Conway's Game of Life
What is it?<br>
"The Game of Life was invented in 1970 by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. Conway developed an interest in a problem which was made evident in the 1940’s by mathematician John von Neumann, who aimed to find a hypothetical machine that had the ability to create copies of itself and was successful when he discovered a mathematical model for such a machine with very complicated rules on a rectangular grid. Thus, the Game of Life was Conway’s way of simplifying von Neumann’s ideas. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton which is any system in which rules are applied to cells and their neighbors in a regular grid. Martin Gardner popularized the Game of Life by writing two articles for his column “Mathematical Games” in the journal Scientific American in 1970 and 1971." (Ref 1).

What is it bitchin?<br>
"In the October 1970 issue of Scientific American, Martin Gardner popularized Conway’s Game of Life by describing the game’s capacity to 'open up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata.' Many soon discovered the great power of cellular automata as models of computation. It was determined that cellular automata, as they appear in the Game of Life, have the same computational capacity as Turing machines." (Ref 1).

It is also considered a 'artificial-live' creation and, of course, a great pastime.
